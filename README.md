# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection using VGG-16 & Ensemble Learning

## Problem Definition
Detecting and classifying brain tumors from medical images (MRI/CT scans) is a critical challenge due to the complexity of tumor variations and limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. Manual analysis is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially for small or subtle tumors.  

This project leverages deep learning and ensemble techniques to improve accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in brain tumor detection, assisting clinicians in early diagnosis and better patient outcomes.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Apply normalization, augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom), and noise reduction.
   - Optional tumor segmentation for improved accuracy.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Train a VGG-16 model with transfer learning and ensemble methods.
   - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.

4. **Tumor Classification**
   - Classify images as **Tumor / No Tumor** and detect type (**Benign / Malignant**).

5. **User Interface**
   - Interface for uploading images and receiving classification results with confidence scores.

6. **Inference**
   - Real-time classification of new images with efficient processing.

7. **Visualization**
